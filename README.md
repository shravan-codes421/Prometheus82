## Description
Prometheus 82 is an open-source, Arduino-based electromechanical device designed for precise testing of gamepad input latency. Utilizing a solenoid to physically simulate button presses and analog stick movements, paired with Python software that mimics a game engine, it accurately measures the delay between a physical action and the system's response. Unlike traditional end-to-end latency testing methods using high-speed cameras, which include delays from monitors, GPU frame rendering, and vary depending on specific games, Prometheus 82 directly captures the entire signal chain from physical input to system registration, eliminating these delays. This method ensures consistent testing conditions across different testers, requiring no synchronization of equipment such as monitors, GPUs, or game engines for comparable results. This makes Prometheus 82 an ideal tool for gamepad enthusiasts, developers, and researchers seeking accurate and comparable input latency data.

## Testing Process
This section outlines the testing process for the Prometheus82 device, designed to measure input latency between the controller and a PC.

### Testing Procedure
1. **Test Initiation**  
   The `Prometheus82.exe` program on the PC sends a signal to the "P82" device to activate the solenoid.
2. **Solenoid Movement**  
   The solenoid moves and, at a specific moment, strikes a button or stick on the gamepad.
3. **Interaction Detection**  
   The "Kalih Mute Button" sensor at the end of the solenoid registers the moment of contact.
4. **Signal Transmission**  
   The "P82" device instantly sends a signal to the `Prometheus82.exe` program, confirming interaction with the gamepad's button or stick.
5. **Latency Timer Start**  
   The `Prometheus82.exe` program starts a timer to measure input latency.
6. **Gamepad Signal**  
   Starting from the moment of contact (step 3), the gamepad sends a signal to the PC, received by `Prometheus82.exe`.
7. **Timer Stop**  
   Upon receiving the gamepad signal, the timer from step 5 stops. The elapsed time represents the input latency.
8. **Test Repetition**  
   The program repeats this process 500 times to calculate minimum, average, and maximum latency, as well as jitter.

### Joystick Latency Algorithm
Prometheus 82 uses a standardized **Center-to-Edge** measurement method for analog sticks to ensure consistent comparisons between different controllers.

> [!TIP]
> **Proper Positioning:** For the most accurate results, the distance between the solenoid and the stick should be **~1 mm** before the test starts. This prevents "[unrealistic overloads](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPDL/comments/1tayl2v/standardization_of_stick_testing_on_gamepadlacom/)" caused by the solenoid's extreme speed (3x faster than a human finger), which a player could never replicate.
> 
> ![P82 Positioning Guide](Box_Papers/P82%20Positioning%20Guide.png)

1. **T0 (Start):** The solenoid is activated to strike the stick.
2. **Physical Travel:** The solenoid arm pushes the stick from the center (0%) towards the edge (100%).
3. **Sensor Trigger:** The sensor button (new Reverse Solenoid mod) is pressed exactly when the stick reaches its maximum physical deflection.
4. **T1 (Stop):** The timer stops the precise moment the gamepad reports a logical value of **≥99%** deviation.
5. **Calculation:** Since the hardware design (Reverse Solenoid) captures the end-of-travel event directly, providing a real-time hardware trigger, **no manual offset subtraction is required**.


### Accuracy and Permissible Errors
This section details the measurement precision and potential deviations caused by physical properties, system variability, and device assembly.

#### 1. Device-to-Device Consistency
The discrepancy between different, correctly assembled Prometheus 82 units is minimal, typically around **0.2 ms**. 
* Under ideal, highly optimized conditions, this variation can be as low as **0.012 ms**, as demonstrated in our [comparative study of 5 devices](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPDL/comments/1mdwp2c/testing_the_accuracy_of_5_prometheus_82_devices/).

#### 2. System and Controller Tolerances
While the P82 hardware is extremely consistent, total measurement error can increase due to the PC environment and gamepad design:
* **Analog Sticks:** Permissible error **±1 ms**.
    * *Reason:* Depending on the controller's dead zone settings, the logical signal may trigger before the physical sensor button is fully pressed.
* **Buttons:** Permissible error **±1 ms**.
    * *Reason:* Mechanical play (pre-travel), switch design variations, and slight positioning shifts on the stand.

#### 3. Impact of Gamepad Settings & Format
Software settings on the gamepad can significantly alter latency results.
* **Raw Format:** It is highly recommended to test gamepads in **Raw format** (or the mode that provides the lowest and most stable results if Raw is not available).
* **Dead Zones:** Always minimize the external dead zone in the controller's software to ensure the hardware trigger matches the logical signal as closely as possible.

#### 4. Hardware Recommendations to Minimize Error
* **Arduino Choice:** Use a high-quality Arduino board with a self-delay of **≤0.5 ms**. You can verify this using [this script](https://github.com/cakama3a/Prometheus82/tree/main/ArduinoSpeedTestScript).
* **Connection:** Plug the P82 device directly into a USB port on the PC motherboard. Avoid front-panel hubs or external splitters, as they can introduce jitter.

#### Real-world Consistency (Live Statistics)
The reliability of Prometheus 82 is documented through continuous comparative testing between independent devices and users. You can access the live [Latency Consistency Report here](https://gamepadla.com/latency/).

Based on our verified dataset of dozens of comparable groups:
* **Average Tester-to-Tester Delta:** **0.92 ms** (confirming our **±1 ms** permissible error guideline).
* **High Consistency:** **50.0%** of all test pairs match within a tight **0.50 ms** range.
* **Top-tier Accuracy:** Optimized setups and high-quality hardware can achieve average deltas as low as **0.16 ms**.
* **Controller Variance:** Discrepancies above 1.00 ms (occurring in ~33% of pairs) are typically linked to specific controller models or firmware versions that exhibit higher internal jitter or varied processing logic.

## Notes and tips
- **Maintenance:** The movement of the solenoid should be easy and smooth. Ensure the leg is free of snags to avoid friction, which can introduce measurement errors and increase wear.
- **Power Supply:** For a 12V solenoid, set the power trigger to **15V** to guarantee stable results. See this [comparison of 6V vs 12V](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPDL/comments/1laafjl/nerd_stuff_comparison_of_prometheus_82_on_6v_and/) and the video on [solenoid-only delays](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPDL/comments/1kv7ys9/i_finally_bought_a_camera_that_can_record_1000/).
- **Connectivity:** The control board has two Type-C ports: the **lower** port is for power, and the **upper** port is for the PC connection.
- **Testing Protocol:** Always run tests at least **2 times**. Recalibrate the gamepad position on the stand between runs to avoid positioning errors.
- **Degradation:** Solenoids can degrade over time, especially if overheated. Use a "control" gamepad (with known stable firmware) to periodically check if the tester's results remain consistent.
- **No Modifications:** Do not modify the hardware or code. The system is optimally calibrated for the components listed in this guide; unauthorized changes will skew results.
